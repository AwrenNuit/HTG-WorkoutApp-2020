# homebody

## Description
Hack the Gap Project - April 2020. Workout app for quarantine. Users can select the type of workout they want to do, how long they want to work out for, and what equipment they want to use. Then they are given a selection of exercise videos matching their criteria. There is also a list of popular videos. Who needs a gym when you've got a homebody?
